Hi Hrithik, 

Described below is the take-home assignment for the web scraping job profile. We'll be assessing the quality(includes readability, modularity) of the code you write -- Please use Python & Scrapy only.

Task: You're supposed to scrape PDF files from the NPC-Philippines website from the following links:

After scraping, save the PDFs and metadata like Title, Date etc. in some data objects in Python.

When you're done, share the repository with us, make it executable on localhost with instructions on a Readme.
